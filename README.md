# Cryptography CIA – Semester 6  
**Author**: Madhavv Arul  
**Roll Number**: 22011102053  

## Overview
This repository is a C++ implementation of various **classical cryptographic algorithms**, built as part of the Semester 6 Cryptography CIA. 
It demonstrates the fundamental working principles of historical ciphers that laid the foundation for modern cryptography.

## Implemented Algorithms

| Cipher Name           | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Caesar Cipher**     | Substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number.        |
| **Atbash Cipher**     | Simple cipher mapping A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.                                    |
| **August Cipher**     | Variant of the Vigenère cipher using a keyword.                             |
| **Affine Cipher**     | Uses a linear function `E(x) = (ax + b) mod m` for encryption.              |
| **Vigenère Cipher**   | Polyalphabetic cipher using a repeating keyword.                            |
| **Gronsfeld Cipher**  | Similar to Vigenère but uses digits instead of letters as the key.          |
| **Beaufort Cipher**   | Variant of the Vigenère cipher with reversed key table.                     |
| **Autoclave Cipher**  | Also called Running Key cipher; key is derived from the plaintext itself.   |
| **N-gram Operations** | Frequency-based text analysis (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).                    |
| **Hill Cipher**       | Uses matrix multiplication for encryption with linear algebra.              |
| **Rail Fence Cipher** | A transposition cipher that writes text in a zigzag pattern.                |
| **Route Cipher**      | Writes the message into a grid and reads it using a specific route.         |
| **Myszkowski Cipher** | Transposition cipher using keys with repeated characters.                   |
